# Project Tic Tac Toe

## How it works

First of all, you must press the button reset or start to start the game. By pressing reset it will start with 'O' and take turns as 'X'. Player would win the game, when three character as in order by column, row or diagonal. By pressing start, it would choose 'O' or 'X' player randomly.

## Design Process

I, firstly, planned phrases and stages of the game on workflow.txt, and then writing my code according to the stage. I can, by doing so, __laser focus on completing current stage of the program__ other than distracted by irrelevant factor of the stage. I should not adding extra CSS effect on the page while I am on the stage of designing start button function, for instance. __Defining core goal__, moreover, is one of the paramount factor on pragram design. Designer must get their head around on core objective of the program, we shall not distracted by extra features and irrelvant tasks during the process. TicTacToe, for example, is a game of player X and O with condition to win, lose or draw, the goal should not be shifted to create strong computer AI player. By this approach, I ensure myself stay focus on writing code according to the stage and core goal of the program. After completing and testing the game, my goal then shift to code organizing and code architect. 

## Notable remark and challenges
  ### Less is more - _to be less, you must know more to refine_

The challenge part comes from logic of winning and draw. I felt confident and thrill to accomplish the winning logic of the game, though I spent some time on testing and explored different logic options.
In fact, I spent most time on coding architect. I portrait myself as a project architect in the team, responsibilty create reusable code, process and coding room for my team. 
Having design code that teammates can reuse, understand and modify it within a short span of time is my primary goal.
I was constantly aware of declaration of variable in global or local scope, fundamental of the functions, maintainability of code, reusability and coding my program as condense without affecting the readability. 
I believe I can do better on different areas, such as more generic design on function. 

## Cool tech 
  ### Proundly present to you, while most of you might know it

Fundamental of functions, higher order function, first class function, difference between inheritance and function composition, the use of spread operator. 
It is amuse to explore what the limitation on functions, what and how values are return by function on different situations. When you console.log(fn()), it prints out value of a function
whereas console.log(fn), it prints out the whole function. 

 
## Lessons Learned
 ### stay hungry, stay foolish

The most impressive things I learn in this project is that different people have different talents. 
Some of my classmates are good at CSS and HTML design, some are interested on AI, some are better on hadnling function and logic,
__I am so appreciate my lovely classmates show me their work and talent, and boarden my knowlege base on those area.__
I believe my strength lies on exploring all these boring dreadfull fundametals, maths and architect. To understand the fundamental helps me to
create grounds for talent developers and faciliate the merge of different talents. Indeed, I regret that some ideas such as settimeout on player turns, 
display on who's player, some Prank & computer play, havn't yet been implement.
